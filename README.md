# ionic3-angular4-sample-app

This source code is part of [Ionic 2 and Angular 4 Mobile App Example](https://www.djamware.com/post/58e657b680aca764ec903c2d/ionic-3-and-angular-4-mobile-app-example)

But i copied just to test the angular form array, thanks djamware!!

after clone this repo, place the terminal in the root, execute npm i, i have node version 10.36 and npm 
version 6.9.0

This is a great example of how to add and remove form controls programmatically.

Why i am using this repo? because i was needing some ionic 3 example.
